# Local AI

RepoHarbor's AI features run entirely **on-device** — nothing leaves your machine. There are two interchangeable backends; pick one in **Settings → AI & search**. When AI is off or unreachable, every AI affordance is hidden rather than broken.

## What it powers

- **Repo summaries** — a synthesized "what is this / what's been happening" blurb on each card, generated on demand or in bulk.
- **Commit messages** — drafted from your staged diff in the repo drawer.
- **Changelogs** — summarised from recent history.
- **Daily briefing** — a one-line "here's where things stand" across your workspace.
- **Resume catch-up** — what changed in a repo since you last looked (see [The repo drawer](./repo-drawer)).
- **Semantic search** — embeddings-backed search over your repos. *(Ollama backend only.)*

## Choosing a backend

| | **Ollama** | **llama.cpp (bundled)** |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Install Ollama separately | Ships with release builds — download a model |
| Models | Any Ollama model | A GGUF you download in Settings |
| Embeddings / semantic search | ✅ | — (generation only) |
| Best for | Existing Ollama users, semantic search | Zero-dependency, out-of-the-box generation |

The backend selector takes effect immediately, and the panel only shows the controls relevant to the engine you picked.

## Setup — Ollama

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and make sure it's running (default endpoint `http://localhost:11434`).
2. Pull a small chat model and an embedding model:

```sh
ollama pull qwen3:0.6b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

3. In **Settings → AI & search**, choose the **Ollama** backend, confirm the endpoint, enable AI, and pick your models. Hit **Test** to verify the connection end-to-end.

::: tip Model choice
A small model like `qwen3:0.6b` is plenty for the short summaries RepoHarbor generates and keeps things fast. Point the endpoint at a remote Ollama host if you'd rather run the model elsewhere.

## Setup — llama.cpp (bundled)

Release builds bundle a local `llama-server` engine, so there's nothing to install separately.

1. In **Settings → AI & search**, choose the **llama.cpp** backend.
2. Click **Download model** to fetch a small default GGUF (≈400 MB) into `~/.local/share/repoharbor/models/`. You can also point it at any GGUF URL.
3. Enable AI and generate a summary — the engine starts on demand and shuts down with the app.

The engine binary is discovered in this order: an explicit path you set in Settings, the bundled copy unpacked into `~/.local/share/repoharbor/bin/`, then `llama-server` on your `PATH`. If you build from source rather than installing a release, supply a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) `llama-server` by any of those routes.

::: tip Generation only
The llama.cpp backend serves text generation. Embeddings — and therefore semantic search — stay on the Ollama backend, so that one feature is hidden while llama.cpp is selected.

## Where data is stored, and clearing it

Summaries and embeddings are cached in `~/.local/share/repoharbor/cache.sqlite`. A summary is keyed to the repo's last commit, so it regenerates after new work lands. Use **Clear AI cache** in settings to drop all summaries and embeddings.

## Turning it off

Uncheck **Enable AI features**. The grid, drawer, and toolbar drop every AI control — no empty placeholders, no broken buttons.
