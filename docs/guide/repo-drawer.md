# The repo drawer

Click any card in [Mission Control](./mission-control) to slide out the repo drawer — a focused detail view that never leaves the grid. It's organised into tabs, and the footer keeps the same [launch actions](./launchers) as the card.

## Overview

The home tab for a repo:

- **Branches** — every local branch with its upstream and ahead/behind state; switch branch in a click.
- **Recent commits** — the latest history with author and relative time.
- **Worktrees** — list, add, and remove linked git worktrees. Create one to work on a branch in parallel, or to drop an [agent](./launchers) into an isolated tree. Removing a worktree unlinks it; the folder stays on disk.

## Changes

Everything for turning working changes into a commit:

- **Staged diff** — a syntax-aware view of what's staged.
- **AI commit message** — draft a message from the staged diff, then commit inline. *(Shown when [AI](./local-ai) is on.)*
- **Changelog** — summarise recent history into release-style notes.

## PRs

For repos hosted on GitHub, the **PRs** tab is a compact action panel over the repo's open pull requests:

- **CI checks** — the rolled-up status plus individual check runs.
- **Reviews** — who approved or requested changes, and the overall review decision.
- **Mergeability** — clean vs. conflicting.
- **Quick-merge** — merge a PR with the method you choose, limited to the methods the repository actually allows (squash / rebase / merge). You can also approve from here.

This is the fastest path from "CI is green" to "merged" without opening a browser. See also the [Inbox](./inbox-feed-explore) for PRs across every repo at once.

## Notes

A scratchpad that belongs to the repo, plus a catch-up:

- **Notes** — free-text notes per repo, autosaved and stored in the local cache. Good for "where was I", a TODO, or context you don't want in the codebase.
- **Resume** — a "what changed since I last looked" banner: the count of new commits, and (with AI on) a short synthesized catch-up. RepoHarbor remembers the commit you'd last seen, so the catch-up is scoped to exactly the new work.

## Readme

The repo's rendered `README`, so you can remind yourself what a project is without switching apps.
