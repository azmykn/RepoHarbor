# Launchers

Every repo card is a launchpad. RepoHarbor has four launch actions, each with its own colour identity, and a one-click preset switcher in Settings so you never have to hand-write a command.

## The four actions

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Open in IDE** | Opens the repo in your configured editor. |
| **Agent** | Drops a terminal coding agent into the repo (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, …). |
| **Folder** | Reveals the repo's directory in your file manager. |
| **Open on host** | Opens the repo's GitHub/GitLab page in your browser (when it has a remote). |

The IDE and Agent buttons show the configured tool's logo and name (e.g. *VS Code*, *Claude Code*) and stay neutral so the brand reads cleanly; Folder and Open-on-host carry their own accent colours.

## Preset switcher

In **Settings → Launchers**, pick your editor and agent from preset chips with real brand logos — no command syntax required.

- **Open in IDE** — VS Code, VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Sublime Text, Fleet, Lapce, the JetBrains family (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, CLion, Rider, RustRover, PhpStorm), Emacs, GNOME Builder, Kate, Geany.
- **Terminal agent** — two axes: a **terminal emulator** (Kitty, Alacritty, Ghostty, WezTerm, Foot, Konsole, GNOME Terminal, xterm) and an **agent CLI** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Aider, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, Crush, Qwen Code). Picking a terminal preserves your agent and vice-versa.

The active preset highlights in the action's colour. Detection round-trips, so the chips reflect whatever the saved command resolves to.

## Custom commands

Prefer to hand-roll it? The raw command field stays available under each preset row. Use `{path}` where the repo path should be substituted, e.g.:

```text
code {path}
kitty --working-directory {path} -e claude
```

Any command that doesn't match a preset simply shows no highlighted chip and falls back to a generic glyph on the cards.
