# Mission Control

Mission Control is the home view: a windowed grid of every repo RepoHarbor found across your workspace roots. It's built to scale to hundreds of repos — the grid is virtualized, so only what's on screen is rendered.

## The repo card

Each card fuses local git state with host enrichment and an optional AI summary:

- **Language logo** — a full-colour mark for the detected primary language.
- **Slug & path** — `owner/repo` (if it has a remote) and the abbreviated on-disk path.
- **Description** — the README's first line, with the AI summary on its own line when available.
- **Git status row** — branch, ahead/behind divergence, and uncommitted-change count. Clean repos stay quiet — no badge, since clean is the unremarkable default.
- **Host row** — a lock for private repos, CI state, stars, latest release, last-commit time, and the host icon.
- **Launch actions** — Open in IDE, Agent, reveal Folder, and Open on the host. See [Launchers](./launchers).

## Filtering & sorting

The toolbar and chip row narrow the grid:

- **Visibility** — `All` / `Public` / `Private`. Public means a non-private remote; private covers private remotes *and* local-only repos (which aren't published anywhere).
- **Chips** — `Dirty`, `Ahead`, `Starred`, `Stale`, Stageable / Commitable / Pushable (multi-select).
- **Attention** — repos that need action (merge conflicts, reviews, dirty work, behind, …). Cards show reason badges and a suggested-action line; an empty filter shows **All clear**.
- **Pull behind** — toolbar action that fleet-pulls every repo currently behind upstream.
- **Sort** — by Activity, Name, or Stars.
- **Roots & Languages** — the sidebar filters by workspace root and detected language.

The activity graph at the top summarises recent commit activity across the visible repos; toggle it from the toolbar.

### Projects & saved views

The sidebar adds two ways to carve up a large workspace:

- **Projects** — tag repos to group related work, then filter the grid to one tag.
- **Saved views** — capture the current filter/sort/visibility combination as a named preset and jump back to it in one click. Presets persist locally.

## Selecting repos

Each card has a checkbox; select one or more (or use the toolbar's select-all) to bring up the **fleet bar** for batch git operations across the selection. See [Fleet operations](./fleet).

The toolbar **Actions ⚙** menu runs the same fleet ops (Fetch, Pull, Stage, Commit, Discard, Submodule Update, …). Keyboard shortcuts on the current selection:

- <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F</kbd> — Fetch selected
- <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> — Pull selected

**Pull behind** (toolbar / command palette) selects every repo with `behind > 0` and fleet-pulls them — useful for upstream Odoo/core trees you keep current without hunting the Behind chip. Pair with **pull-only prefixes** in Settings so those trees never offer Push and upstream CI stays off the Attention chips (silence — you'll only hear about it if a push is attempted and fails).

## List view

Switch to a compact, single-line view from the segmented control — useful when you're scanning a lot of repos at once.

## The repo drawer

Click a card to slide out a detail drawer with the repo's branches, recent commits, staged-diff view, README, a PR/CI panel, and per-repo notes — plus the same launch actions in the footer.

It's covered in full on its own page: [The repo drawer](./repo-drawer).

## Command palette

Press <kbd>⌘K</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl K</kbd> to search repos and run commands without leaving the keyboard.

It also does **cross-repo code search**: type a query and RepoHarbor runs [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) across your repos, returning matching files and lines you can open directly — a fast way to find that one call site across the whole fleet.
