# Inbox, Feed & Explore

Beyond your local repos, RepoHarbor pulls in what's happening across your git hosts and splits it into three purpose-built views.

## Inbox

The Inbox is for things that need *you*: open pull requests, review requests, assigned issues, and notifications — grouped and counted.

It answers "what's waiting on me right now?" across GitHub and GitLab. RepoHarbor also polls these in the background and raises desktop notifications for new PRs, review requests, and CI failures — see [Notifications & tray](./notifications).

## Feed

The Feed is the social/news stream — releases and activity from the repos and people you follow or have starred (think a personal "release radar").

Releases show their tag; starred/created/forked events show who did what. The feed is cached for 30 minutes and refreshes on demand.

## Explore

Explore is a browser for the repos you've starred, with one-click clone straight into a workspace root.

Each card shows the description, language, and star count; **Clone** drops it into your first configured root so it shows up in Mission Control on the next scan.

## Caching & offline

Host data (enrichment, feed, notifications) is cached locally with sensible TTLs and falls back to the last good snapshot when offline — so these views stay useful without a connection, and visibility/stars survive restarts without a re-fetch.
