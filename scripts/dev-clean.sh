# dev-clean — run RepoHarbor from a clean slate.
#
# Use this when a relaunch keeps showing stale state — most commonly a changed
# app icon or anything embedded at compile time (assets are embedded via
# rust-embed) that `cargo` doesn't treat as a source change, so a normal
# `cargo run` reuses the old binary.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Stops any running repoharbor process.
#   2. Forces the asset build script to re-run by touching the embedded assets
#      (recompiles ONLY our crate, not its deps).
#   3. Runs `cargo run -p repoharbor`.
#
# Flags:
#   --deep   hard reset: full `cargo clean` (slow — rebuilds every dependency).
#   --no-run clean only; don't launch afterwards.
