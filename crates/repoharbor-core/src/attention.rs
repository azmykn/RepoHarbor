//! The attention engine's pure core (#183): fold everything RepoHarbor already
//! knows — local git state, the host inbox, CI, branch hygiene, agent
//! sessions — into one prioritized "needs you now" list.
//!
//! No I/O and no UI live here. Callers gather the facts (the scan snapshot,
//! an inbox fetch, CI polls, `git_ops::prunable`, the platform crate's agent
//! detection) and hand them to [`compute`]; every surface — sidebar badges,
//! the grid's Attention filter, the tray icon, toasts, notifications —
//! consumes the same ranked output, so urgency is decided in exactly one
//! place.
