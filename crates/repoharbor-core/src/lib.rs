//! repoharbor-core — RepoHarbor's logic, free of any UI or Tauri.
//!
//! Modules are re-exported as-is from the original single-crate layout, so the
//! inter-module `crate::model` / `crate::config` paths keep resolving here. The
//! legacy Tauri app re-exports these under its own `crate::` namespace; the
//! native GPUI app depends on them directly as `repoharbor_core::*`.
