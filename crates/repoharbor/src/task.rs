//! Bridge async (network / AI) core calls onto the GPUI foreground.
//!
//! GPUI's background executor can poll futures but provides no tokio reactor, so
//! reqwest-backed core calls (`forge` / `inbox` / `ai` / `oauth`) — which need
//! one — can't run on it directly. We own a single shared multi-threaded tokio
//! runtime and hand each result back through a one-shot channel that the calling
//! gpui task awaits.
//!
//! This is the one spot `repoharbor` (the app) owns a runtime (everything else lives in
//! `repoharbor-platform`); on-demand UI data fundamentally needs an in-app reactor.
